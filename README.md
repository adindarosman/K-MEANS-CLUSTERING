## Overview Of The Project
K-means is a non-hierarchical grouping method that tries to divide existing data into one or more clusters. This method partitions data into clusters so that data with the same characteristics in the same cluster and data with different characteristics are grouped into other clusters. The K-means algorithm clusters data by trying to include samples in n groups of the same variance, minimizing a criterion known as inertia or the number of squares in the cluster. Silhouette Coefficient is used to see the quality and strength of the cluster, how well an object is placed in a cluster. This method is a combination of cohesion and separation methods. In this Project, I used the iris dataset which has 150 records and each record contains 5 features or variables (1 class).
